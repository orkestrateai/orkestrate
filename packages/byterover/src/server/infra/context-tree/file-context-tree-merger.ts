/**
 * File-based implementation of IContextTreeMerger.
 *
 * Merge decision per file (remote hash compared against last snapshot hash):
 *   - Remote unchanged  → skip; local version wins regardless of local state.
 *   - Remote changed, local clean, preserveLocalFiles=false → overwrite with remote (regular pull).
 *   - Remote changed, local clean, preserveLocalFiles=true  → conflict (first-time connect; no
 *     shared history so the local file is not treated as "old").
 *   - Remote changed, local also changed                    → conflict.
 *   Conflict handling: local copy saved to .brv/context-tree-conflicts/ and renamed _N.md;
 *   remote content written to the original path.
 *
 * Clean local files absent from remote are deleted (preserveLocalFiles=false) or preserved
 * (preserveLocalFiles=true). Locally-deleted files are re-created if remote has a newer version.
 *
 * A full backup of the context tree is taken before each merge and used for automatic rollback
 * on failure. The backup is deleted after a successful merge.
